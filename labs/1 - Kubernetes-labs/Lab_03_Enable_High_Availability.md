### Lab 3 - Making Kubernetes Highly Available through the GUI

You can choose to make Kubernetes on DC/OS high availability (HA) at the time of deployment. However, you can also make non-HA clusters into HA by editing and saving the configuration. 

In the DC/OS UI under Services, click on Kubernetes Cluster 1 (Not kube-proxy).

In the top right, click Edit.

Under Kubernetes in left hand menu, choose the high availability box

Save configuration and watch new components come online with the following command or in the GUI. Output should look like below:

```
$ watch dcos kubernetes manager plan status deploy --name=kubernetes-cluster1

deploy (serial strategy) (COMPLETE)
├─ etcd (serial strategy) (COMPLETE)
│  ├─ etcd-0:[peer] (COMPLETE)
│  ├─ etcd-1:[peer] (COMPLETE)
│  └─ etcd-2:[peer] (COMPLETE)
├─ control-plane (serial strategy) (IN_PROGRESS)
│  ├─ kube-control-plane-0:[instance] (COMPLETE)
│  ├─ kube-control-plane-1:[instance] (COMPLETE)
│  └─ kube-control-plane-2:[instance] (COMPLETE)
├─ mandatory-addons (serial strategy) (COMPLETE)
│  └─ mandatory-addons-0:[instance] (COMPLETE)
├─ node (parallel strategy) (COMPLETE)
│  └─ kube-node-0:[kubelet] (COMPLETE)
└─ public-node (serial strategy) (COMPLETE)

```

**Notice that in high availability mode, DC/OS has started 3 etcd peers and 3 kube-control-plane processes. If any of these processes die, DC/OS will monitor their health and automatically restart them.**
