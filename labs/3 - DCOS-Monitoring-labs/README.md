# DC/OS Days: Prometheus and Grafana Labs

Welcome to the DC/OS Prometheus and Grafana lab exercises. 

Please see the `/labs` directory for course materials. 

Please note that these lab exercises are designed to be used in conjuction with other course content delivered in a DC/OS workshop environment. As a result, the labs assume you have a working cluster with the DC/OS CLI installed and configured.
